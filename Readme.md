## Decisions

- Use Harry Potter instead of Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres
- Use book 2 title Harry Potter and the Professor's Games, to respect Eliezer's preference
- Use book 6 title Harry Potter and the Mirror's Stone, to respect Eliezer's preference that if you only use Harry Potter instead of the full name, that you use Mirror's Stone to preclude name clashes with the original series
